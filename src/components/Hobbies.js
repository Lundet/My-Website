        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          When I'm not working on web development, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that help me stay creative and balanced.
        </p>

        <h2>Esports and Streaming</h2>
        <p>
          I love esports and have spent a lot of time playing competitively, especially in League of Legends where I've reached Master Tier. This shows my competitive spirit, strategic thinking, and dedication.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also enjoy sharing my gaming experiences with others. You can find my live streams on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lundet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a> and my recorded content on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRe_1SKE84GFzgbpG_eEPPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Music Production</h2>
        <p>
          I enjoy making music with FL Studio and playing guitar in my free time. It's a great way to unwind and express myself. Music allows me to take a break from coding and have some creative fun.
